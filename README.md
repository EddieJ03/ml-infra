# MiniMLPlatform

A quick ML infra project on Azure.

Uses Pulumi, so install that first https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/

Then run `pulumi up --yes --skip-preview` to set up all the defined resources on Azure.

See previously ran experiments: http://minimlplatform.duckdns.org/mlflow
